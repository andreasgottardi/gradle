# Gradle projects
In this repository I will collect [Gradle](https://gradle.org) scripts for different purposes. Each build script will be described in its project folder. The scripts use the Gradle wrapper for easy execution.
# Background
I first got introduced to Gradle a few years ago and while beeing unsatisfied with the xml based configurations of other build systems I appreciated the source code like language in the Gradle build scripts.
